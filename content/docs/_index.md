## Welcome to the SysOps Framework

Traditional agile methodologies like Scrum and SAFe have revolutionized software development, but they fall short when applied to system administration and operations teams. The **SysOps Framework** is a purpose-built methodology designed specifically for system administrators, system engineers, and operations teams who cannot work within traditional sprint boundaries but still need structured, efficient, and continuously improving workflows.

- **Chapter 1: The Challenge**
  Understand why traditional agile methodologies fail operations teams and what makes operations work fundamentally different.

- **Chapter 2: Core Principles**
  Learn the six core values that drive the SysOps Framework and how they differ from traditional agile values.

- **Chapter 3: Framework Structure**
  Discover the multi-cycle approach that replaces traditional sprints with operational reality.

### Implementation Guide

Ready to implement? Follow this structured approach:

- **Chapter 4: Comparison**
  Compare SysOps with traditional methodologies to understand when and how to apply each approach.
