## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:
- The six core management practices that support the SysOps Framework
- How to implement each practice effectively
- Integration points between practices and operational cycles
- Maturity models for continuous practice improvement

## 🎯 The Six Core Management Practices

The SysOps Framework incorporates six essential management practices tailored specifically for operations teams. Unlike generic IT management approaches, these practices acknowledge the unique constraints and requirements of system administration work.

### 1. 📊 Service Level Management

**Purpose**: Establish clear service level objectives (SLOs) and service level indicators (SLIs) for all critical services, implementing error budgets to balance reliability with the pace of change.

#### Key Components

**Service Level Indicators (SLIs)**:
- Availability: Percentage of time service is operational
- Latency: Response time for user requests
- Throughput: Volume of successful requests processed
- Quality: Percentage of requests served without errors

**Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**:
- Target values for each SLI (e.g., 99.9% availability)
- Time windows for measurement (e.g., monthly, quarterly)
- Business justification for each target level
- Clear consequences for missing objectives

**Error Budgets**:
- Allowable amount of unreliability (100% - SLO)
- Tracking of budget consumption over time
- Policies for when error budget is exhausted
- Balance between reliability and feature velocity

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Service Inventory**: Catalog all services and their criticality levels
2. **SLI Selection**: Choose measurable indicators that matter to users
3. **SLO Definition**: Set realistic but challenging targets based on business needs
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement automated tracking and alerting
5. **Error Budget Management**: Create policies for budget consumption and replenishment

#### Example Service Level Management

**Service**: Customer Authentication API
- **Availability SLI**: Successful login attempts / Total login attempts
- **Availability SLO**: 99.95% measured monthly
- **Latency SLI**: 95th percentile response time
- **Latency SLO**: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Error Budget**: 0.05% = ~22 minutes downtime per month

### 2. 🚨 Incident and Problem Management

**Purpose**: Develop comprehensive incident response procedures with clear escalation paths and communication protocols. Implement blameless post-incident reviews to capture lessons learned and prevent recurrence.

#### Incident Management Process

**1. Detection and Alert**:
- Automated monitoring and alerting systems
- Clear alert severity classification
- On-call rotation and escalation procedures
- Initial response time targets based on severity

**2. Response and Triage**:
- Immediate response protocols
- Severity assessment and classification
- Resource allocation and team coordination
- Stakeholder communication procedures

**3. Resolution and Recovery**:
- Systematic troubleshooting approaches
- Escalation procedures for complex issues
- Service restoration verification
- Communication of resolution to stakeholders

**4. Post-Incident Review**:
- Blameless timeline reconstruction
- Root cause analysis techniques
- Action item identification and assignment
- Knowledge base and runbook updates

#### Problem Management Process

**Distinction from Incident Management**:
- **Incident Management**: Restore service quickly
- **Problem Management**: Prevent incidents through root cause elimination

**Problem Identification**:
- Patterns in incident data
- Proactive monitoring and trending
- Stakeholder feedback and requests
- Known error database maintenance

**Problem Resolution**:
- Root cause analysis methodologies
- Change request generation for fixes
- Workaround documentation and communication
- Resolution verification and testing

#### 🎮 Interactive Scenario: Incident Response

**Scenario**: At 2:30 AM, monitoring alerts indicate that the customer database is responding slowly. Login times have increased from 200ms to 3000ms. Customer support is starting to receive complaints.

**Exercise**: Apply the incident management process:

1. **Detection**: What information do you need immediately?
2. **Response**: Who should be contacted and in what order?
3. **Triage**: What's the likely severity level?
4. **Resolution**: What are your first three diagnostic steps?
5. **Communication**: What should you tell stakeholders and when?

**Framework Response**:
1. **Detection**: Check database performance metrics, server resources, network connectivity
2. **Response**: Page database specialist, notify team lead, prepare stakeholder communication
3. **Triage**: Severity 2 (significant impact but service functional)
4. **Resolution**: Check query performance, examine server resources, review recent changes
5. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of investigation within 15 minutes, provide updates every 30 minutes

### 3. 🔄 Change and Configuration Management

## 🎯 Chapter Summary

The six core management practices provide the operational foundation that makes the SysOps Framework effective. Unlike generic IT management approaches, these practices are specifically designed for the interrupt-driven, high-availability world of operations teams.

Success with the SysOps Framework depends on implementing these practices consistently and improving them continuously. They work together to create a comprehensive operational capability that supports all three operational cycles while building team resilience and capability.

The practices should be implemented gradually, starting with basic capabilities and evolving toward more advanced maturity levels as the team develops experience and confidence with the framework.

## 🔮 Looking Ahead
