## üéØ Overview

Traditional agile methodologies like Scrum and SAFe have revolutionized software development, but they fall short when applied to system administration and operations teams. The **SysOps Framework** is a purpose-built methodology designed specifically for system administrators, system engineers, and operations teams who cannot work within traditional sprint boundaries but still need structured, efficient, and continuously improving workflows.

## üìö Documentation Structure

This framework is organized into comprehensive chapters for easy learning and implementation:

- **Chapter 2**: [Core Principles](content/docs/chapter-02-principles.md) - Values and Principles of the SysOps Framework
- **Chapter 3**: [Framework Structure](content/docs/chapter-03-structure.md) - Multiple Operational Cycles

### Part II: Implementation
- **Chapter 4**: [Comparison](content/docs/chapter-04-comparison.md) - Traditional Agile vs SysOps Framework
- **Chapter 5**: [Implementation Strategy](content/docs/chapter-05-implementation.md) - Phased Approach and Roadmap
