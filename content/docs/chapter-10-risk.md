5. **Process Risks**: Human error and procedural failures
6. **Technology Risks**: Hardware failures, software bugs, and vendor dependencies

**Risk Management Principles**:

- **Continuous Assessment**: Risk evaluation integrated into all operational cycles
- **Proactive Mitigation**: Address risks before they become incidents
- **Balanced Decisions**: Consider risk alongside business value and operational needs
- **Documented Rationale**: Clear reasoning for risk-related decisions
- **Learning Culture**: Use incidents and near-misses to improve risk understanding

### Risk Assessment Framework

**Risk Identification Process**:

- **Failure Mode Analysis**: Identify potential failure points and their impacts
- **Threat Modeling**: Analyze security threats and attack vectors
- **Historical Analysis**: Learn from past incidents and industry events
- **Environmental Scanning**: Monitor for emerging risks and threat landscapes

**Risk Evaluation Criteria**:

- **Impact Severity**: Business and customer impact of risk realization
- **Probability**: Likelihood of risk occurring within a given timeframe
- **Detection Capability**: Ability to identify and respond to risk events
- **Recovery Complexity**: Difficulty and time required to recover from risk events
- **Cascading Effects**: Potential for risks to trigger additional problems

### üéÆ Interactive Risk Assessment Exercise

**Scenario**: Your team manages a critical customer database with the following characteristics:

- Contains personal and financial information for 100,000 customers
- Required for all customer transactions and support operations
- Currently running on 5-year-old hardware with limited redundancy
- Backed up daily to offsite storage
- Accessed by 50 internal users and 3 external applications

**Risk Assessment Challenge**:

1. Identify the top 5 operational risks for this system
2. Evaluate each risk using Impact (1-5) and Probability (1-5) scales
3. Calculate risk scores (Impact √ó Probability) to prioritize mitigation efforts
4. Propose specific mitigation strategies for the highest-priority risks

**Sample Framework Response**:

```yaml
Risk Assessment Results:
  Hardware Failure:
    Impact: 5 (complete system unavailability)
    Probability: 4 (aging hardware, no redundancy)
    Score: 20 (Critical)
    Mitigation: Implement hardware redundancy and refresh plan

  Data Breach:
    Impact: 5 (regulatory fines, customer trust loss)
    Probability: 3 (external threats, internal access)
    Score: 15 (High)
    Mitigation: Enhanced access controls and monitoring

  Backup Failure:
    Impact: 4 (data loss during hardware failure)
    Probability: 2 (tested backup processes)
    Score: 8 (Medium)
    Mitigation: Automated backup testing and verification

## üéØ Chapter Summary

Risk management and compliance are not separate activities from operations‚Äîthey must be integrated into every aspect of the SysOps Framework. Success requires embedding risk considerations into all operational cycles, automating compliance evidence collection, and building a culture where risk awareness drives decision-making.

The key is to make risk management and compliance enablers of operational excellence rather than barriers to efficiency. This requires thoughtful integration of controls and processes, automation of routine compliance activities, and continuous improvement based on risk events and changing threat landscapes.
