### üéÆ Interactive Exercise: Process Integration Challenge

**Scenario**: Your team currently handles incidents reactively and struggles to find time for improvements. You're implementing the SysOps Framework.

**Week 1 Challenge**:
- Monday: Database performance degradation (4 hours to resolve)

**Questions**:
1. How would you structure daily operations cycles around these incidents?
2. What patterns would you identify for weekly improvement planning?
3. How would you maintain team morale while implementing new processes?

**Framework Response**:
- **Daily Cycle**: Handle each incident with structured response, documentation, and review
