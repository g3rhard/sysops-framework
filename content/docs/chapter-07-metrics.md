## üìä The SysOps Metrics Framework

![SysOps Metrics Dashboard](../assets/sysops-dashboard.png)

Traditional agile metrics like velocity and story points don't capture the value that operations teams provide. The SysOps Framework requires different metrics that reflect operational realities and demonstrate business value. Our metrics framework organizes measurements into four key categories, each serving different stakeholders and decision-making needs.

## üõ°Ô∏è Service Reliability Metrics

- **Target Range**: 99.9%+ for critical services, 99.5%+ for important services
- **Measurement**: Automated monitoring with synthetic transactions
- **Business Value**: Direct correlation to revenue and customer satisfaction

**Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**

- **Definition**: Average time from incident detection to service restoration
- **Target Range**: <30 minutes for critical services, <2 hours for standard services
- **Measurement**: Incident tracking from alert to resolution confirmation
- **Business Value**: Minimizes business impact of service disruptions

**Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**

- **Definition**: Average operational time between service failures
- **Target Range**: >720 hours for critical systems
- **Measurement**: Time tracking between incident occurrences
- **Business Value**: Indicates system stability and reliability investment effectiveness

**Service Level Objective (SLO) Compliance**

### üéÆ Interactive Exercise: Efficiency Optimization

**Scenario**: Your team currently handles 200 tasks per month. Analysis shows:

- 80 tasks are fully manual (40%)
- 60 tasks are partially automated (30%)
- 40 tasks are fully automated (20%)
- 20 tasks are ad-hoc/undefined (10%)

**Challenge Questions**:

1. What's your current automation coverage percentage?
2. Which task category should you prioritize for automation?
3. What would be a realistic 6-month automation target?
4. How would you measure the business value of automation improvements?

**Framework Approach**:

1. **Current Coverage**: 20% fully automated + 15% (half of partial) = 35%
2. **Priority**: Standardize ad-hoc tasks first, then automate high-frequency manual tasks
3. **Target**: 60% automation coverage (realistic 25% improvement)
4. **Value Measurement**: Time savings √ó hourly cost + error reduction + capacity for strategic work

## üéØ Chapter Summary

Effective measurement is crucial for demonstrating the value of the SysOps Framework and driving continuous improvement. The four-category metrics approach ensures comprehensive coverage of service reliability, operational efficiency, team performance, and business value.

Success depends on choosing the right metrics for each audience, implementing effective dashboards and reporting, and using metrics data to drive decision-making and improvement efforts. The key is balancing comprehensive measurement with actionable insights that support both operational excellence and strategic business objectives.
